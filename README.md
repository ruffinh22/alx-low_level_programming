## About

- This repository consists of all the C programming projects done with [ALX Africa](https://www.alxafrica.com/) Full stack Software Engineering course in partnership with [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/) by [th3\_gr00t](https://th3-gr00t.tk/).
- All main.c files are prewritten by the school. We build functions that produce a specific output while also taking into consideration edge cases.

- C is fun but its not that easy, so I have some [notes](./notes.md) that will actually show you the journey and thought process.
